# CUhacks-2018
Currently Incomplete.

## Purpose
We found an issue with Alexa where you can't simply ask it when the next bus will come by. We decided to try to fix this for CUHacking 2018

## Description
Short Alexa skill that allows users in Ottawa to get bus route times easily. Ideally it could use Alexa's location to determine bus stops near the user.


## Roadmap
* [ ] Fix skill returning skill error on input rather than displaying the data from OCtranspo API
* [ ] Implement geolocation to get bus stops nearby rather than just giving stop number
* [ ] Allow users to get estimated time to a destination
